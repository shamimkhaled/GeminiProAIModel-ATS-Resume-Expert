#### Key Features:
- Resume Upload: Users can upload their resumes in PDF format.
- Job Description Input: Users can enter the job description they're applying for.
#### Three Functionalities:
- Tell Me About the Resume: Provides an overall evaluation of the resume's alignment with the job description.
- How Can I Improvise My Skills: Offers specific recommendations on how the candidate can improve their skills and experience to better match the job requirements.
- Percentage Match: Calculates the percentage of match between the resume and job description, highlights missing keywords, and provides final thoughts.
#### Functionality Breakdown:
##### Import Necessary Libraries:

- base64: For encoding/decoding data.
- streamlit: For creating the web app interface.
- os: For interacting with the operating system.
- io: For handling input/output operations.
- PIL: For image processing.
- pdf2image: For converting PDFs to images.
- google.generativeai: For interacting with Google's generative AI models.
- dotenv: For loading environment variables.

#### Configuration:
- Load environment variables (including Google API key).
- Configure the Maker Suite Google API.
#### Functions:
- get_gemini_response: Calls the Gemini Pro AI model to generate content based on provided inputs and prompts.
- resume_pdf_setup: Converts a uploaded PDF resume to a list of images.

#### Streamlit App Setup:
- Sets page title and header.
- Creates text input for job description.
- Creates file uploader for resume.
- Creates buttons for the three functionalities.
- Defines prompts for each functionality.

#### Button Actions:
- Each button triggers a conditional block that calls get_gemini_response with appropriate inputs and prompts.
- The generated response is then displayed on the Streamlit app.
